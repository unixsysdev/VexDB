### 2.3 IVF Index Implementation - **CRITICAL DECISION POINT**

**⚠️ Major Implementation Risk**: No production-ready pure Go IVF libraries exist.

**Option Evaluation (Must decide before proceeding):**

- [ ] **Evaluate IVF implementation approaches:**
  - **Option A**: CGO bindings to FAISS (production-ready but deployment complexity)
  - **Option B**: Pure Go IVF implementation from scratch (6-8 weeks development)

- [ ] **Prototype and benchmark all approaches:**
  - [ ] Test go-faiss CGO bindings with deployment complexity
  - [ ] Implement basic linear search as baseline/fallback
  - [ ] Estimate pure Go IVF development effort vs performance needs

**If choosing Option A (CGO/FAISS):**
- [ ] Setup CGO build pipeline with C++ dependencies
- [ ] Implement FAISS integration layer
- [ ] Handle FAISS index persistence and loading

**If choosing Option B (Pure Go IVF):**
- [ ] Research IVF algorithm implementation details
- [ ] Implement K-means clustering for centroid calculation
- [ ] Build inverted list data structures
- [ ] Create distance calculation optimizations (SIMD where possible)

## Estimated Timeline

**Total Development Time**: 22-30 weeks (5.5-7.5 months)

**Critical Path Items**:
1. Core storage engine with segment management
2. IVF index implementation and optimization
3. Multi-protocol ingestion layer
4. Integration testing and performance validation

**Parallel Development Opportunities**:
- vxinsert and vxsearch can be developed concurrently after vxstorage core is complete
- Protocol adapters can be implemented independently
- Testing and tooling can be developed alongside core features

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Start with minimal viable IVF implementation
- Implement comprehensive testing early
- Plan for performance optimization iterations
- Maintain focus on core functionality before advanced features
